MuJoCo for Python!
==================

This is a simple python wrapper around the MuJoCo physics simulation. I wrote it when I couldn't get `mujoco-py 
<https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py>`_ to work. 

Installation
------------

Working on getting a `pypi` script working. In the mean time, install from source:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install -e /path/to/cloned/directory
